# Visual Model Server

This server is running on a Django backend.

## Instructions
1. In this directory, run `python manage.py runserver` to run this server on port 8000 (default).
2. There is no view for `localhost/`. This is by design. Go to `localhost/identify/` to see server instructions.
3. To run this server on a particular port, use `python manage.py runserver <insert port>`.
